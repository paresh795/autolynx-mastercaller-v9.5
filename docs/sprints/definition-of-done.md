## Exception Process

### **When DoD Cannot Be Met**
1. **Document Exception**: Clearly document what cannot be completed and why
2. **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate and document risks of proceeding
3. **Stakeholder Approval**: Get explicit approval from Product Owner and Tech Lead
4. **Mitigation Plan**: Create plan to address gaps in future sprint
5. **Technical Debt**: Log technical debt items for future resolution

### **Approval Authority**
- **Minor Exceptions**: Tech Lead approval
- **Major Exceptions**: Product Owner + Tech Lead approval
- **Security Exceptions**: Security team approval required

---

## Review Process

### **Story Review Checklist**
Before marking a story as "Done", the following review must occur:
1. **Self Review**: Developer completes DoD checklist
2. **Peer Review**: Code review by another team member
3. **Testing Review**: QA verification of acceptance criteria
4. **Product Review**: Product Owner validation of functionality

### **Continuous Improvement**
- Definition of Done reviewed and updated quarterly
- Team retrospectives identify DoD improvements
- Quality metrics tracked to validate DoD effectiveness

This Definition of Done ensures that every deliverable meets the high standards required for a production-ready, enterprise-quality system.

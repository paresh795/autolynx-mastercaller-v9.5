# AutoLynx Cold‑Call System — Architecture v1.0

> Author: *Architect* Status: Draft for review Scope: CSV‑driven outbound cold‑calling campaigns using Vapi; Next.js + Supabase; no chat UX.

---

## 1) Purpose & Summary

A simple, robust system to:

- Upload a CSV with `name, business_name, phone`.
- Launch and control a cold‑calling campaign with a **global concurrency cap**.
- Track every call precisely; show real‑time progress and outcomes.
- Be cheap/easy to host on **Vercel (frontend+API)** and **Supabase (Postgres + Auth)**.

Design pillars:

- **Event‑driven truth** via **webhooks**; **no long background loops**.
- **Call‑ID tracking (primary)** for correctness; **phoneNumber polling (fallback)** for health/ops.
- Keep complexity down: short Vercel functions + cron ticks.

Non‑goals: live chat, advanced multi‑tenancy today.

---

## 2) System Context

**Actors**: Admin users (allow‑listed), Supabase DB, Vapi (telephony/assistant), Vercel (Next.js + Cron).

**High‑level flow**

1. User uploads CSV → `POST /api/campaigns` → records written to DB → campaign enters **Created**.
2. **Scheduler tick** (Vercel Cron, 1–2 min): starts new calls up to the **cap**.
3. Vapi **webhooks** push call state changes → DB updated → dashboard reflects truth.
4. When all calls terminal → campaign **Completed**.

---

## 3) Components

- **Next.js App (App Router)** on Vercel: UI + API routes.
- **Assistant Directory & UI**: create/import/manage persistent **Vapi assistants**; select one per campaign.
- **Vercel Cron**: triggers `/api/scheduler/tick`.
- **Supabase Postgres**: campaigns, contacts, calls, events, **assistants**; Supabase Auth.
- **Vapi**: assistant + phone calls + webhooks.

---

### 3.1) Assistant Directory & Lifecycle (new)

Goal: replace ad‑hoc "Create Assistant"/"Delete Assistant" nodes with a **first‑class Assistant Directory**.

- **Persistent assistants**: Users can create assistants inside our app (we call Vapi `POST /assistant` once and persist the returned `assistantId`). We **never auto‑delete** persistent assistants.
- **Import existing**: Users can paste a Vapi **assistantId** to register an external assistant for reuse.
- **Templates**: We seed 2–3 stock assistants (e.g., "Voicemail‑friendly", "Short Pitch", "Discovery") that users can clone and tweak.
- **Selection per campaign**: `assistantId` is mandatory when creating a campaign; the campaign simply references a **registered assistant**.
- **Optional ephemeral assistants**: Supported via a flag (`ephemeral=true`) for advanced cases; only these may be auto‑deleted after use. Default is **persistent=false → do not delete**.
- **Versioning (lightweight)**: We store `config_json` (prompt/voice/model) in our DB. Editing an assistant updates `config_json` and also PATCHes the assistant on Vapi. (Full history/version table is optional later.)

**Why this design**

- Keeps creation/deletion **out** of the calling hot path.
- Avoids accidental deletion of assistants used by active or future campaigns.
- Makes campaign creation simple and deterministic: select one ID and go.

## 4) Concurrency Model & Batch Semantics

Two modes (user selects per campaign):

- **Mode A – Continuous Cap (default)**: Keep `active_calls ≤ cap`. Each tick fills available room.
- **Mode B – Strict Batching (optional)**: Contacts partitioned into batches of `cap` size. Only start batch *N+1* when all calls in batch *N* are terminal (based on our DB, not external queries).

**Definitions**

- *Active call*: status in {`QUEUED`,`RINGING`,`IN_PROGRESS`}.
- *Terminal*: status in {`ENDED`,`FAILED`,`CANCELED`,`TIMEOUT`}.
- *Campaign Started*: first successful 2xx from `POST /call` recorded.
- *Campaign Completed*: zero active calls **and** at least one call exists for the campaign.

**Stuck handling**: If a call receives no event for >10m, mark `TIMEOUT` and proceed.

#### 4.1 Gating strategy (configurable)

- **Default (recommended)**: **Call‑ID truth**. Batches advance when all calls we created for the batch are terminal **according to our DB** (fed by Vapi webhooks). This is precise and light on Vapi APIs.
- **Optional (advanced)**: **Line‑quiet gating**. Also require `activeCalls(phoneNumberId) == 0` before starting the next batch. This mirrors your n8n approach. It is disabled by default because it’s coarser and can be affected by unrelated calls, but it’s available as a toggle per campaign if you want it.

#### 4.2 Cron cadence (what it is & defaults)

- **Cron cadence** means **how often the scheduler tick runs** to launch new calls (e.g., every 60s).
- **Default**: **every 60 seconds**, with a tiny in‑code jitter (±10%) to avoid thundering herd.
- **Why 60s**: keeps the system responsive without hammering the provider; combined with the cap, it bounds how many create‑call requests we can produce.
- **Rate‑limit safety**: With `cap=8`, worst‑case we post up to 8 new calls per minute per campaign; the cap ensures we don’t exceed concurrency even if webhooks are slow.

---

## 5) Monitoring Strategies (we keep both)

- **Primary: Call‑ID tracking** — we persist provider `call_id` on creation and accept authoritative updates from webhooks. Optional per‑call reconcile (backoff) if a webhook is missed.
- **Fallback/Health: phoneNumber polling** — occasional `GET /call?phoneNumberId=...` to show “line active” count on the dashboard. *Never used to gate batches.*

Rationale: Call‑ID gives precision and low API load. PhoneNumber polling gives quick, coarse health signals.

---

## 6) APIs (public within app)

### Assistants

- **List** — `GET /api/assistants`

  - Query: `q?` (name contains), `active?`
  - Returns: paginated assistants with `id`, `provider_assistant_id`, `name`, `source`, `active`.

- **Create (local)** — `POST /api/assistants`

  - Body: `{ name, config: { model, voice, systemPrompt, options... } }`
  - Behavior: create on Vapi → persist in `assistants` (store `provider_assistant_id`, `config_json`).

- **Import (external)** — `POST /api/assistants/import`

  - Body: `{ providerAssistantId, name? }`
  - Behavior: validate existence on Vapi → upsert into `assistants` with `source='imported'`.

- **Update** — `PATCH /api/assistants/[id]`

  - Body: partial fields (`name`, `config`, `active`)
  - Behavior: PATCH Vapi assistant (if config changed) + update DB.

- **Delete (manual only)** — `DELETE /api/assistants/[id]`

  - Behavior: only allowed if **no active campaigns** reference it. Never auto‑deleted by call flows.

### Campaigns

- **Create Campaign** — `POST /api/campaigns`

  - **multipart**: `contactsCsv`
  - JSON: `{ name?, cap?, mode? ('continuous'|'batch'), assistantId: uuid, phoneNumberId }`
  - Validates: assistant exists & active; phone number present.
  - Response: `{ campaignId, totalContacts, createdAt, cap, mode }`.

- **Scheduler Tick (Cron)** — `POST /api/scheduler/tick`

  - Body: `{ campaignId? }`
  - Response: `{ campaignsProcessed, launched, active, queued, cap }`.

- **Vapi Webhook** — `POST /api/webhooks/vapi`

  - Auth: shared secret.
  - Body: Vapi event; we map to `call_events` and update `calls`.

### Read Models (UI)

- `GET /api/campaigns` — list with summary stats
- `GET /api/campaigns/[id]` — details (contacts, progress, metrics)
- `GET /api/calls?campaignId=...` — paginated calls
- `GET /api/assistants/[id]` — details + where used
- `GET /api/health/phone-line?campaignId=...` — optional line activity indicator

## 7) Data Model & SQL (Supabase / Postgres)

> Enable extension for UUIDs (Supabase generally has `pgcrypto`).

```sql
-- one‑time
create extension if not exists pgcrypto;

-- enums
create type if not exists call_status as enum (

  provider_assistant_id  text unique not null,
  config_json            jsonb not null default '{}'::jsonb,
  active                 boolean not null default true,
  ephemeral              boolean not null default false,
  created_at             timestamptz not null default now(),
  updated_at             timestamptz not null default now()
);
create index if not exists idx_assistants_active on assistants(active);

  created_at       timestamptz not null default now(),
  started_at       timestamptz,
  completed_at     timestamptz,
  total_contacts   int not null default 0,
  stats_json       jsonb not null default '{}'::jsonb
);

-- contacts
create table if not exists contacts (
  id             uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  campaign_id    uuid not null references campaigns(id) on delete cascade,
  name           text not null,
  business_name  text not null,
  phone          text not null,
  batch_index    int  not null default 0,
  unique (campaign_id, phone)
);
create index if not exists idx_contacts_campaign on contacts(campaign_id);

-- calls
create table if not exists calls (
  id                uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  campaign_id       uuid not null references campaigns(id) on delete cascade,
  contact_id        uuid not null references contacts(id)  on delete cascade,
  provider_call_id  text unique,
  status            call_status not null default 'QUEUED',
  started_at        timestamptz,

  cost_usd          numeric(10,4),
  recording_url     text,
  transcript_json   jsonb,

  last_status_at    timestamptz not null default now()
);
create index if not exists idx_calls_campaign_status on calls(campaign_id, status);
create index if not exists idx_calls_provider on calls(provider_call_id);

-- immutable event log
create table if not exists call_events (
  id         uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  call_id    uuid not null references calls(id) on delete cascade,
  status     call_status not null,
  payload    jsonb not null,
  created_at timestamptz not null default now()
);
create index if not exists idx_call_events_call on call_events(call_id);
```

**Transcript storage — decision**: keep full transcripts in `calls.transcript_json` (JSONB). It’s simple, queryable, and avoids extra storage plumbing. If a transcript ever becomes exceptionally large, we can switch to uploading to object storage and keeping a pointer, but for v1 we keep it inline.

**RLS**: off for now (single tenant). When moving to multi‑tenant, add `org_id` to all tables, enable RLS with policies, and use Supabase Auth JWT claims.

---

## 8) Key Flows (Step‑by‑Step)

### 8.0 Assistant lifecycle (pre‑campaign)

1. **Create** in app → we call Vapi `POST /assistant` with `config_json`; store `provider_assistant_id` in `assistants`.
2. **Import** from Vapi → user pastes `provider_assistant_id`; we validate it exists, then upsert in `assistants`.
3. **Edit** → PATCH both our DB `config_json` and Vapi assistant.
4. **Delete (manual)** → only allowed if no active campaigns reference it. **No auto‑deletion** during call flows.

### 8.1 CSV Upload → Campaign Create

1. Parse CSV; normalize phones (`+E.164`).
2. Create `campaigns` row with `cap`, `mode`, `phone_number_id`, optional `assistant_id`.
3. Insert `contacts` (assign `batch_index` if `mode=batch`).
4. Update `campaigns.total_contacts`.
5. Schedule next **tick** ASAP (store a timestamp or just rely on Cron cadence).

### 8.2 Scheduler Tick (Mode A: Continuous Cap)

1. `active = count(calls where status in active for campaign)`.
2. `room = max(0, cap - active)`.
3. Select next `room` contacts that don’t yet have a call.
4. For each contact: \*\*use the campaign's \*\*`` → resolve to `assistants.provider_assistant_id` → `POST /call` → create `calls` row with `provider_call_id` and `QUEUED`; set `started_at`.
5. If first launched → set `campaigns.started_at`.

### 8.3 Scheduler Tick (Mode B: Strict Batching)

1. Determine smallest `batch_index` with outstanding contacts not yet called.
2. If any call in that batch is active → do nothing.
3. Else launch calls for remaining contacts in that batch (up to cap).

### 8.4 Webhook Handling

1. Verify secret; discard if invalid.
2. Look up `calls.provider_call_id`.
3. Insert `call_events` (immutable), update `calls` with mapped status, costs, transcript, URLs.
4. If `no active calls remain` and `≥1 call exists` → set `campaigns.completed_at`.

### 8.5 Fallback Health Check (phoneNumber)

- UI calls a thin API that queries Vapi `listCalls(phoneNumberId, status not ended)` occasionally (e.g., 60–120s) for a **line activity badge**. Informational only.

---

## 9) Error Handling, Retries & Timeouts

- **Create call**: on non‑2xx, retry with exponential backoff (cap at 3 tries, 1s→4s→10s). If still failing, record a `FAILED` call row.
- **Webhook gaps**: if a call has no event for 10m, mark `TIMEOUT`.
- **Cron idempotency**: launching selects contacts **without** existing `calls` row; safe on retries.
- **API rate limits**: bounded by `cap` and tick cadence; optional jitter (±10%) on cron to avoid bursts.

---

## 10) Auth & Authorization

- **Supabase Auth** (magic link or OAuth).
- **Allow‑list**: maintain `allowed_users(email text primary key)` or `app_metadata.allow=true`; gate all UI/API routes via middleware.
- Future multi‑tenant: add `orgs` table and `org_id` FKs + RLS policies.

---

## 11) Deployment & Config

**Environments**: `dev`, `prod`.

**Vercel**: Next.js build; API routes must return quickly (<10s). Cron: `/api/scheduler/tick` every 1–2 minutes.

**Env Vars (.env.example)**

```
SUPABASE_URL=
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
DATABASE_URL=

VAPI_API_KEY=
VAPI_PHONE_NUMBER_ID=
# Prefer selecting assistants from the **Directory**; this remains optional for single‑assistant setups
VAPI_ASSISTANT_ID=

WEBHOOK_SHARED_SECRET=
CRON_SHARED_SECRET=
```

---

## 12) Observability & Metrics

- **Tables** already capture granular events.
- Derived metrics per campaign: total calls, active, ended, failed, timeout, success rate, average cost, average duration.
- Alerts (Slack/email) on: webhook auth failures, stuck calls, failure ratio > threshold.

---

## 13) Security

- Verify webhook secret; reject if missing.
- Do not log PII beyond what’s needed; redact transcripts in logs.
- Principle of least privilege: use Supabase service role key **only** in server routes.

---

## 14) Testing Strategy

- Unit: CSV parser, phone normalization, status mapping.
- Integration: mocked Vapi for createCall + webhook flows.
- E2E: deploy to `dev`, real Vapi sandbox number, small CSV (≤3 contacts).

---

## 15) Operational Defaults (finalized)

- **Cron cadence**: every **60 seconds** with small in‑code jitter (±10%).
- **Concurrency cap**: default **8**. Configurable per campaign. (You chose 8 to stay under Vapi’s 10 free concurrent limit.)
- **Gating strategy**: **Call‑ID truth** is the default; **Line‑quiet gating** using `phoneNumberId` is available as an optional toggle per campaign (off by default). The dashboard still shows line activity as a health widget.

## 16) Risks & Mitigations

- **Missed webhook** → reconcile on next tick by polling *only* missing call\_ids; mark `TIMEOUT` after 10m.
- **Provider hiccups / rate limits** → `cap` limits creation rate; exponential backoff; jittered cron.
- **Dashboard drift** → source of truth is our DB; health widget is advisory only.

---

## 17) Implementation Plan (phased)

0. **Assistant Directory**: tables + CRUD + Vapi create/import/update; seed 2–3 templates.
1. DB schema + CRUD basics; CSV upload; campaigns list/detail (assistant required).
2. Vapi integration: createCall using assistant from campaign; webhook handler; dashboard updates.
3. Scheduler tick (continuous cap); stuck/timeout handling.
4. Optional strict batching; phoneNumber health widget.
5. Auth allow‑list + polish; alerts; cost/export.

## 18) Decisions Locked‑In

- **Assistant selection**: assistants live in the Directory (created or imported) and are selected via dropdown at campaign start. Reuse across campaigns is expected.
- **Cron cadence**: **60s** default, jittered.
- **Cap**: **8** by default; user‑configurable per campaign.
- **Transcript storage**: `calls.transcript_json` inline (JSONB) for v1.

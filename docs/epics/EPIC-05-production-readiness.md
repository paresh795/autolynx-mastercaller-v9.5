# EPIC-05: Production Readiness

## Epic Overview
Prepare the system for production deployment with robust authentication, comprehensive monitoring, error handling, performance optimization, and operational tooling to ensure reliability and maintainability.

## Business Value
- Ensures system security and access control
- Enables proactive issue detection and resolution
- Provides operational visibility
- Reduces mean time to recovery (MTTR)
- Ensures system meets performance SLAs

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Authentication enforced on all endpoints
- [ ] Allowlist controls user access
- [ ] All errors logged with context
- [ ] Alerts configured for critical issues
- [ ] P95 response time <2 seconds
- [ ] System handles 100 concurrent campaigns
- [ ] Zero security vulnerabilities in dependencies

## User Stories
- **US-5.1**: Supabase Auth Integration
- **US-5.2**: Allowlist Management Interface
- **US-5.3**: Comprehensive Error Handling
- **US-5.4**: Logging & Observability Setup
- **US-5.5**: Performance Optimization

## Technical Components
- Supabase Auth configuration
- Middleware for auth enforcement
- Structured logging system
- Error tracking service integration
- Performance monitoring
- Database query optimization
- Caching layer implementation

## Dependencies
- All core features implemented
- Production environment configured
- Monitoring services selected
- Security audit tools available

## Acceptance Tests
1. Unauthenticated request → 401 response
2. Non-allowlisted user → Access denied
3. API error → Logged with stack trace
4. Database query >1s → Alert triggered
5. 100 concurrent users → System responsive
6. Dependency scan → No high severity issues
7. Load test → Meets performance targets

## Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Auth bypass vulnerability | Critical | Security testing, code review |
| Performance degradation | High | Load testing, monitoring |
| Alert fatigue | Medium | Tune thresholds, prioritize |
| Logging costs | Low | Log sampling, retention policies |
| Dependency vulnerabilities | High | Automated scanning, updates |

## Definition of Done
- Auth required on all protected routes
- Allowlist CRUD interface functional
- Error handling covers all code paths
- Logging captures key operations
- Alerts configured for P0/P1 issues
- Load testing proves 100 campaign capacity
- Security scan passes
- Runbook documentation complete

## Metrics
- Authentication success/failure rate
- API endpoint response times (P50, P95, P99)
- Error rate by category
- Alert response time
- System uptime percentage
- Security scan findings

## Notes
Production readiness is crucial for system credibility and reliability. This epic ensures the system can handle real-world usage, recover from failures gracefully, and provide operators with confidence in the platform. Special attention should be paid to security best practices and operational excellence.

# EPIC-04: Advanced Features

## Epic Overview
Implement advanced features including batch calling modes, comprehensive export functionality, health monitoring, and analytics dashboards to provide operators with powerful campaign management capabilities.

## Business Value
- Enables different calling strategies (continuous vs batch)
- Provides comprehensive campaign results export
- Offers real-time health monitoring of phone lines
- Delivers actionable insights through analytics
- Improves operational decision-making

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Strict batch mode processes contacts in defined groups
- [ ] CSV export includes all call details and outcomes
- [ ] Phone line health status visible in dashboard
- [ ] Analytics show success rates, costs, and duration metrics
- [ ] Export completes within 30 seconds for 10,000 records
- [ ] Real-time dashboard updates without page refresh

## User Stories
- **US-4.1**: Strict Batch Mode Implementation
- **US-4.2**: Continuous Cap Mode Refinement
- **US-4.3**: Campaign Results CSV Export
- **US-4.4**: Phone Line Health Monitoring
- **US-4.5**: Analytics Dashboard

## Technical Components
- Batch assignment and tracking logic
- CSV export streaming generator
- Phone line status polling service
- Analytics aggregation queries
- Real-time dashboard subscriptions
- Export queue for large datasets

## Dependencies
- Call engine and webhook system operational
- Database populated with call data
- Real-time subscription infrastructure
- Frontend framework for dashboard

## Acceptance Tests
1. Enable batch mode → Calls launched in groups of cap size
2. Batch completes → Next batch starts automatically
3. Export 5,000 records → CSV generated with all fields
4. Monitor phone line → Active call count displayed
5. View analytics → Accurate metrics calculated
6. Dashboard open → Updates arrive within 2 seconds
7. Export during active campaign → Current data included

## Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Large export memory issues | High | Stream CSV generation |
| Analytics query performance | Medium | Materialized views, caching |
| Real-time update delays | Medium | WebSocket fallback to polling |
| Phone line API rate limits | Low | Cache results, respect limits |

## Definition of Done
- Both calling modes fully functional
- Export handles 10,000+ records efficiently
- Health monitoring accurate and timely
- Analytics calculations verified correct
- Dashboard performs well with multiple campaigns
- Export includes all required fields
- Documentation covers mode selection

## Metrics
- Export generation time by record count
- Dashboard update latency
- Analytics query performance
- Health check API call frequency
- Mode usage distribution
- Export completion rate

## Notes
These advanced features differentiate the system from basic calling solutions. The batch mode is particularly important for users who need controlled, sequential calling patterns. The analytics dashboard will be a key decision-making tool for operators.
